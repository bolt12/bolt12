## Armando Santos 🚀

### Haskell Consultant at [Well-Typed](https://well-typed.com/)

---

🎓 **Background**:  
Holding a Master’s in Computer Engineering from the University of Minho, I've honed my skills around Formal Methods in Software Engineering and Distributed Systems. The intricacies of algebra of programming, abstract mathematics, and elegant library design captivate me.

🔍 **Professional Highlights**:  
Beyond consulting, I'm deeply involved in the Functional Programming community with several contributions to open-source. My recent engagement with the netowrking team at IOG (Cardano blockchain company), has honed my expertise in meshing functional programming with real-time distributed systems.

🛠 **Passions & Learning**:  
My dedication extends beyond just functional programming. I deeply care about program correctness and am passionate about crafting elegant, correct, and composable programs using Denotational Design. Currently, I'm expanding my toolkit by diving into [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda), pushing the boundaries of my understanding in program correctness.
